Reliance was founded by his late father Dhirubhai Ambani, a yarn trader, in 1966 as a small textile manufacturer.
After his father's death in 2002, Ambani and his younger sibling Anil divvied up the family empire.
In 2016, Reliance sparked a price war in India's hyper-competitive telecom market with the launch of 4G phone service Jio.
Jio has signed on more than 300 million customers by offering free domestic voice calls, dirt-cheap data services and virtually free smartphones.
